Check difference between bool and boolean

Users table - GlobalSuspensionEndDate column
  should probably be a separate table (UserID, SuspensionStart, SuspensionEnd) to keep a history of SuspensionStart

UsersSuspensions table - all those *BanEndDates
  should probably have a SuspensionType table with a foreign key to this table 

Posts table - Where to put attachments: files, pics (fiddle embeds?)

Posts table - Score column
  is this a calculated field (eg: (10 * Upvotes) - (5 * Downvotes))

NOT NULL inconsistency.  Spec should include 'NOT NULL' for all non-nullable columns
Need cascade rules for ON DELETE, ON UPDATE foreign keys
Table Comments for: CommentsVotes, Tags, PostsTags
