Schema Proposal

Check difference between bool and boolean

Users table - GlobalSuspensionEndDate column
  should probably be a separate table (UserID, SuspensionStart, SuspensionEnd) to keep a history of SuspensionStart

UsersSuspensions table - all those *BanEndDates
  should probably have a SuspensionType table with a foreign key to this table 

Posts table - Where to put attachments: files, pics (fiddle embeds?)

Posts table - Score column
  is this a calculated field (eg: (10 * Upvotes) - (5 * Downvotes))

UsersSites references but doesn't have a UsersID

NOT NULL inconsistency.  Spec should include 'NOT NULL' for all non-nullable columns
Need cascade rules for ON DELETE, ON UPDATE foreign keys
Table Comments for: CommentsVotes, Tags, PostsTags

I have chosen BigInt with the type of IDENTITY instead of BigSerial for primary keys.  I assume we are on postgresql >= 10.0?


Schema Proposal Round 2

Change Log:
Users table took on a bunch of 'UsersSites' fields
UsersSites table renamed to UsersCommunities
Sites table renamed to Communities


Are Communites' fiels not null (helptext, faq, isBeta)?
Topic Posts debate: manassehkatz is right: all those things are Posts
cwellsx is right Topics and Posts are different.  Topics contain post(s?)

All those Is's in Posts table: PostsTypeID linked to different tables with specific bits is the best pattern in my understanding
  Possibly (if they're 1:1, with the PostID as PK)
Same as what (check?) said about all the privileges in UsersCommunities in forum comments, and all the bans in UsersSuspensions

Also not sure about the ParentID column in tables.  I'd prefer a separate PostFamily table with ParentPostID, ChildPostID, or even PostId, RelatedPostID and RelationTypeID for children (answers), siblings (related) and possibly (making it up as I go along now) grandparents for old dupes

Users<del>Sites</del>Communities references but doesn't have a UsersID


Schema Proposal Round 3

Communities table - change from 'IsBeta bool' to 'Status enum'.  Is there a StatusType table?  Where does te enum come from?

TrustLevelCommunity table has no comment
TrustLevelCommunity table has no TrustLevel FK (I added one)

MemberCommunityPrivilege relations - FKs to Member, Community: why not FK to MemberCommunity?

Tag table - SynonymTagID - does this assume only one synonym for each tag, not a possible bunch or have i understood tags incorrectly

TrustLevel table - gave table comment to TrustLevelCommunity table

I seem to have a 'template_pk_cp' primary key identifier somewhere I have to search & replace
